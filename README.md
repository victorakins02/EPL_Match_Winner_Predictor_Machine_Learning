# Premier-League-Predictor

## Description
A machine learning-based Python project that predicts winners in English Premier League football matches. The pipeline involves:
- Collecting historical match data  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Model training, evaluation, and interpretation  
- Predicting upcoming match results  

---

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of historical EPL data  
- Feature engineering (e.g., recent form, goals scored/conceded, venue)  
- Selecting and tuning classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)  
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, ROC curves  
- Prediction capability for upcoming fixtures  

---

## Requirements
- **Python** 3.8+  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn` (adjust as needed)  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate team/player statistics (e.g., recent wins, injuries)  
- Explore advanced ML & ensemble methods (XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Run hyperparameter optimization using tools like GridSearchCV  
- Deploy the model as a web app or API
